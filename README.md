# House-Robot-3D
For the 3D Games Programming module of my degree I wrote a basic 3D game engine in C++, using the DirectX9 libraries. I also wrote classes for basic AI behaviours such as seek, flee, hide and a flanking attack. I also wrote a basic dialogue system. I then implemented these features into a prototype game demo.
